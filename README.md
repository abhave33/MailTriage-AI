# MailTriage-AI
MailTriage AI is a personal project built to explore intelligent email triage and response assistance using sample email data. The goal is to simulate how an AI system can help users prioritize and understand large volumes of emails efficiently—specifically focusing on intent classification and summarization.


## ✉️ Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates the development of a basic email triage assistant using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The assistant can:

- Classify emails into categories (e.g., urgent, follow-up, ignore)
- Extract key information
- Suggest next actions

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses sample email data (`Alex_emails_march_04.csv`), which includes anonymized email content intended for educational and prototyping purposes. I either found or created this sample to reflect realistic communication patterns in a professional context.

## 🧠 Features Implemented

- Email preprocessing and text cleaning
- Keyword extraction and intent tagging
- Rule-based classification logic for triage decisions
- Visualization and insights into email frequency and types

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, nltk, matplotlib
- CSV-based data ingestion

## 🚀 Future Ideas

- Train a machine learning model for email classification
- Integrate sentiment analysis
- Deploy as a Streamlit or web-based AI inbox assistant
